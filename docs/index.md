# Brand guidelines

The Logos Brand Guidelines serve as the foundation of Logos' outward identity. As a grassroots movement committed to developing the technology and community from which networks states may form, Logos is rooted in a set of core values and principles that guide its overall branding strategy.

At the heart of the Logos Brand Guidelines is a modular approach that allows for flexibility and adaptability. By breaking down the guidelines into smaller components, it becomes easier to build and maintain a cohesive brand identity that can evolve with the movement. This modularity ensures that all Logos sub-brands share the same DNA and core values while allowing for customization to meet the unique needs of each sub-brand.
