# Non-web environments

In non-web and print environments, we suggest using free/open-source fonts or the default fonts provided by the most common operating systems and devices. These fonts should follow the following criteria:

- Be close to the default fonts already provided on the most common operating systems and devices, to ensure consistency and ease of access.
- Have an extensive character set to support various languages and scripts.

We recommend the following free/open-source fonts that meet the above criteria:

| Font Type | Suggested Default Font Family |
| --- | --- |
| Mono | [Iconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?query=inconso), [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono), [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) |
| Serif | [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) |
| Sans-Serif | [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) |
